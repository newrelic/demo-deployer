# Demo Deployer

![Test](https://github.com/newrelic/demo-deployer/workflows/Test/badge.svg?event=push)

The deployer is a Ruby application that you can use to deploy and configure resources in various cloud environments.

## Demo Catalog

While you can build components and deployment configurations for the deployer, we have created a set of demos so that you can hit the ground running with no prior work.

To learn how to use the deployer and run a demo, read our [Demo documentation](demo/README.md).

## Developer

For more advanced insights of what the deployer is and does, check the [Developer documentation](documentation/developer/README.md). There, you'll learn about the deployer's architecture and how to run and test the application locally.
