# Docker

The Deployer can be run through docker. It's a convenient way to run the deployer, since all the required dependencies will be handled through the docker image, versus fiddling with the right versions of python, ruby and ansible to install.

To install docker, follow the steps documented at [Install Docker](install/README.md).

To run the deployer with docker, follow the steps in the [Run with docker](run/README.md).
