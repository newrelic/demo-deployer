# Diagnosing High Response Times

In this tutorial, you'll use New Relic to understand why **Telco-Warehouse Portal** has slower than normal response times.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you're familiar with the [infrastructure of Telco Lite](README.md#application-design), you've [set up your local environment](prereqs.md), and you've [deployed and instrumented the Telco Lite services](deployment.md).

## Start with APM

To begin, log into [New Relic One](one.newrelic.com) and select **APM** from the top navigation menu. Here, you see an overview of all eight Telco Lite services, including the service names, response times, and throughputs. Notice that the response time for **Telco-Warehouse Portal** is unusually high:

![APM overview](imgs/high-response-times.png)

Select the **Telco-Warehouse Portal** service name from the APM overview to see a summary of that service. The top graph in the summary view shows **Web transactions time**:

![APM transaction time summary](imgs/apm-summary.png)

You see several peaks, reaching almost 50,000 millisecondsâ€”or 50 seconds! From this graph, you can actually gain a little more insight by toggling the colored components beneath the graph. For example, select **Node.js**:

![APM Node.js transaction time](imgs/apm-node.png)

The graph changed to show only what the Node.js component contributes to the overall response time: less than 100 ms, in this example. Now, select **Web external** and deselect **Node.js**:

You can see that external web traffic is the primary contributor to the high response times. That's a good start, but "external web traffic" is vague and unhelpful. Next, you'll dive deeper into the specifics of what makes up that component.

## Move to distributed tracing

So, you know that **Web external** is the culprit of the high response times, but it's hard to tell why. External web traffic is all the requests made from your service to other services. This means you should look into what external requests that the warehouse portal makes to try to understand exactly what external service is the bottleneck.

Select **Monitor > Distributed tracing** from the left-hand navigation:

![Distributed tracing overview](imgs/dt-overview.png)

This view shows you requests to the warehouse portal. Select a request from the table at the bottom of the view to see a trace through that request:

![Specific trace](imgs/dt-trace.png)

From this trace, you can learn that one external request contributes almost all of the total trace duration. Specifically, an external request to the **Telco-Fulfillment Service** contributes over 99% of the overall response time.

This is good news! You own the fulfillment service, which means you can drill down for even more information. Select the offending row (called a span), and then select **Explore this transaction**:

![Span details](imgs/dt-span-details.png)

## Explore a transaction

You're now looking at the `__main__:inventory_item` transaction overview. Because you know that some part of this transaction is slow, you can use this transaction overview to narrow your focus even further.

Similar to how you modified the warehouse portal APM graph, you can look specifically at the components of this transaction to understand where the root cause of the slowness is. Another way to view this information is to scroll down to the **Breakdown table** in that same view:

![Transaction breakdown](imgs/transaction-breakdown.png)

Here, you see that the segment `Function/__main__:inventory_item`, a Python function, contributes over 99% of the overall response time.

At this point, you know that **Telco-Warehouse Portal** is slow because it makes an external request to **Telco-Fulfillment Service**, which is slow. You also know that the issue in the fulfillment service is local because 99+% of the request is spent in Python code, not external services. Take a step back to the fulfillment service's summary page to look at the service as a whole, instead of this single transaction:

![Fulfillment transaction time summary](imgs/apm-fulfillment-summary.png)

## Search the service summary

Scroll down on this view to familiarize yourself with the graphs it shows, such as **Throughput** and **Error rate**. At the bottom of the page, you can see a table with the fulfillment hosts. You can't currently drill into a specific host in the new UI (we're working on it), but you can in the old UI. Toggle **Show new view** to "off" and select the host link:

![Switch to the old UI](imgs/old-ui.png)

## Examine the infrastructure

Now, you're looking at graphs in the infrastructure view for that service's host. Notice that the CPU % has a lot of high spikes. Click and drag on the graph from the start of a spike to the end of it to narrow the time slice to the period when CPU utilization goes up:

![CPU spike](imgs/cpu-spike.png)

If you compare this graph to the fulfillment service's transaction graph you looked at earlier, you'll see that soon after `__main__:inventory_item` begins executing, the CPU utilization of the host sharply rises to 100%!

## Observe the dependencies

Now, you understand the problem causing slow response times in the warehouse portal, but you don't know the extent of the issue. Using service maps, you can see all your services that are dependent on the fullfillment service.

Navigate to the service map under **APM > Telco-Fulfillment Service**:

![Service map](imgs/service-map.png)

This map shows you the fulfillment service's incoming and outgoing dependencies. Not only is **Telco-Warehouse Portal** dependent on the fullfillment service, but so is **Telco-Web Portal**!

Select the web portal node to see that the fulfillment service also affects the web portal's response times:

> **Extra Credit:** Notice that the web portal's response times aren't nearly as high as those in the warehouse portal.
>
> Using the same steps you used to diagnose the issue in the warehouse portal, can you discover the difference between the two services?

## Conclusion

At the end of your investigation, you discovered:

- **Telco-Warehouse Portal** is slow because it makes an external request to **Telco-Fulfillment Service**, which is slow
- The fulfillment service's Python function contributes over 99% of the response time
- Soon after the Python function starts executing, the host's CPU utilization spikes up to 100%
- The fulfillment service also affects **Telco-Web Portal** response times

Now, as the developer behind the fulfillment service, you have enough information to debug the issue causing the CPU spikes. Congratulations!
